# Travis 

Travis w NodeJs

### Why Travis ?

Testing your work (to be sure its working as expected) is the most important part of a project.

Continuous Integration is a software development process
in which all development work is integrated at a predefined time
or event and the resulting work is automatically tested and built.
The idea is that development errors are identified very early in the process.
